# Page_Replacement_Algorithm_GUI
Page Replacement Algorithm is one of the most important topics in the subject of Operating System. The working of the Operating System is incomplete without the implementation of the Page Replacement Algorithm.

I with my 4 team members have created this project of creating a Desktop App for Visualization of Page Replacement Algorithm written solely in Java Programming Language. This project is a part of Virtual Lab construction for the subject of Operating System by my university i.e. Pandit Deendayal Energy University, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India under the supervision of the CSE Department of the college. For the construction of the GUI/Desktop App, we have used 7 major libraries for the proper functionality of the project. The 7 major libraries used are as follows:

1. Javax Swing Package for the creation of the desktop application.
2. Java Lang for Exception Handling.
3. Java AWT for designing and drawing of various elements and for the creative look of the desktop.
4. Java Lang Thread class to change between multiple JFrames smoothly and effortlessly.
5. Used JFreeChart library, which is an external jar file to show graph and comparisons graph.
6. Used vlcj library, which is an external jar file to attach the video animation and the voice-over created by the team.
7. Javax Windows Builder method to create the visuals in the GUI.

Here I'm attaching the whole project implementation readme file and pdf with this description to help you compile and run the code efficiently on your machine:-
